I decided to update my website from something slightly ridiculous to something probably as ridiculous but with more effort behind it. I intend to, over the next two weeks, put up some pictures of stuff like lighting I've done, as well as maybe some a cappella arrangements. Hopefully I find this format works fine, and it's definitely easy enough to write that if I have an urge to blog a thing, it will be more likely to happen? maybe? I hope?


I'm also still trying to decide on a proper title for this thing, maybe I want to change the word "vicarious"?

Anyway, this is my first post. Hopefully it's ramblier than average.
