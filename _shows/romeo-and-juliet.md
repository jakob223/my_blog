Romeo and Juliet have been falling in love and dying on stages for four hundred years. But what if they weren’t just characters in a play? What if they were family, friends, neighbors, classmates? Join us for this classic tragedy and experience the laughter and sorrow of Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers in a production that blurs the divide between actors and the characters they portray.
