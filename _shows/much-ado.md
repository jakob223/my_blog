In the Messina gamer’s lounge, a hormone-infused saga of romance and hearsay is about to unfold. When the shy Claudio enlists Pedro, his ultra-popular game wizard friend, to win the heart of the shy and beautiful Hero, it seems like young love will easily triumph. But Pedro’s brother John has other ideas, and one little video changes so much.

Fusing modern technology, gaming, and teenage passion with Shakespeare’s classic tale of romantic manipulation, this MUCH ADO explores questions about social media, cyber-bullying, and youthful naivete.
