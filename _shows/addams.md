*The Addams Family* features an original story, and it’s every father’s nightmare. Wednesday Addams, the ultimate princess of darkness, has grown up and fallen in love with a sweet, smart young man from a respectable family – a man her parents have never met. Everything will change for the whole family on the fateful night they host a dinner for Wednesday’s ‘normal’ boyfriend and his parents. Join us for this contemporary comedy about family, love, honesty, growing up, and how everyone is weird in their own wonderful way. We'll leave the lights off for you.
