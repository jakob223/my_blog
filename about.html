    <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Jakob - Iâ€™m currently a student at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, where I study Computer Science and Mathematics. Of particular interest to me are Secure Computer Systems and Cryptography. I'm currently working on a research project around secure operating systems and type-safe system call interfaces. </p>

<p>I spend my free time mostly on being a part of far too many student groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ensemble.mit.edu">The MIT Shakespeare Ensemble</a>, for which Iâ€™ve acted, built stuff, done lights, technical directed, and most of the other things you can do.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ensemble.mit.edu">The MIT Musical Theater Guild</a>, for which I design lights, sets, and sounds.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hmmt.co">The Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament</a>, a tournament held semianually for high school students from across the country and internationally. Iâ€™ve worked on scripts, problems, and logistics, and I co-directed for the 2016-17 tournament season.</li>
  <li><a href="https://e33.mit.edu">E33 Productions</a>, a group which does lighting for on-campus events held by other groups or entities at MIT. Iâ€™m the president. Hire us for your next event!</li>
  <li><a href="https://sipb.mit.edu">Student Information Processing Board</a>, a student group which helps maintain some of MITâ€™s computing infrastructure. Iâ€™m involved with (or trying to be, anyway), <a href="https://scripts.mit.edu">scripts.mit.edu</a>, the service that hosts a lot of dynamic websites for MIT organizations [and this website].</li>
  <li><a href="http://mafia.mit.edu">Live-Action Mafia</a>, a group that runs week-long games of murder and deceipt a few times per semester. A healthy dose of anticipation about whether youâ€™re about to be murdered is important to a balanced lifestyle.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ec.mit.edu/">East Campus</a>, my dorm, in which Iâ€™ve helped organize our <a href="https://ec.mit.edu/rex_cpw">CPW</a> events and <a href="http://bad-ideas.mit.edu/">Bad Ideas Weekend</a>, where you can try out all the ideas that really should never be tried out.</li>
  <li><a href="http://web.mit.edu/assassin/www/">The Assassinsâ€™ Guild</a>, which runs Live-Action Role-Playing games. I play them, and am working on co-writing a game in the <a href="unsongbook.com">UNSONG</a>a> universe.</li>
  <li><a href="http://dancetroupe.mit.edu/">MIT DanceTroupe</a> for which I do lighting and am dancing in this semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from all that, I like going on adventures of the wandering, cycling, or other varieties. </p>

<p>I enjoy puzzles, both of the more <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/index.html?page=home&amp;_r=0">boring</a> variety, and the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/">more exciting kind</a>. </p>

<p>I enjoy vegetarian cooking, and I run a vegetarian co-op (we call ourselves âŒŠðŸŒ½âŒ‹) in East Campus.</p>
