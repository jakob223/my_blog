    <p>Hi! I’m Jakob. I write software and puzzles sometimes, and make art at other times. </p>
    <p>I work at <a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> writing software to make end-to-end encrypted services more widely available.</p>
    <p>I write puzzles and do organizational things for <a href="https://galacticpuzzlehunt.com">Galactic Puzzlehunt</a>. Some puzzles that I've authored or coauthored that I am proud of include <a href="https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/road-trip">Road Trip</a>, <a href="https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/unsafe">Unsafe</a>, <a href="https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/a-crossword">A Crossword</a>, and <a href="https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/the-galactic-conference">The Galactic Conference</a>. I hunt with ✈✈✈ Galactic Trendsetters ✈✈✈ during Mystery Hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also write crossword puzzles. I've been published so far in the <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/puzzle/crossword/20190819/44311/index.html">Wall Street Journal</a> and the <a href="http://crosswordcrossing.blogspot.com/2018/09/color-mixing-jakob-weisblat.html">Puzzle Society Crossword</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes I do various role-playing games, of both the tabletop and live-action variety. I co-wrote a <a href="https://xavid.itch.io/fading-lights">game called Fading Lights</a> for <a href="https://interconlarp.org">Intercon</a> 2019. It's since run at several other venues.</p>

    <p>In the past, I did some computer systems security research at <a href="https://csail.mit.edu">MIT CSAIL</a>.</p>

    <p>Other things I like include board games, cycling, climbing, electronics tinkering, and vegetarian cooking.</p>
